This project is a classic implementation of the Snake Game, developed using x86 Assembly Language for the 8088 platform. The game runs in text mode or graphics mode, depending on the system or emulator capabilities.

It demonstrates key low-level programming concepts such as direct memory manipulation, interrupt handling, real-time keyboard input, and a custom game loop—all written entirely in assembly.

🎮 Key Features
Responsive snake movement using arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →)

Random food generation at runtime

Score tracking system

Collision detection (walls and self)

Game over screen with restart or exit options

🛠 Technologies Used
Assembly Language (8088)

BIOS/INT interrupts

Text-mode video memory manipulation

DOSBox or EMU8086 (recommended emulator)

📚 Learning Outcomes
This project serves as a hands-on example of:

Low-level hardware interfacing

Real-time input processing

Structuring game logic without high-level abstractions
